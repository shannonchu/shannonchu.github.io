    <h1>Hi, I'm Shannon.</h1>
    <h2>I bring ideas to life using digital and physical mediums.</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a product designer who fuses a background in human cognition and design to create meaningful solutions. My curiosity for how and why the human mind works the way it does paired with my passion for design drives me to work across disciplines to craft products and experiences that people find easy to use, exciting, and meaningful.
