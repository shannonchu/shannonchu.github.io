    <h1>Hi, I'm Shannon.</h1>

    <p>
    I just finished undergrad at UC Berkeley where I studied cognitive science and design innovation. My endless curiosity for how and why the human mind works the way it does paired with my passion for design drives me to work across disciplines to craft products and experiences that people find easy to use, exciting, and meaningful.
