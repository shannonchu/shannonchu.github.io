    <h1>Hi, I'm Shannon.</h1>

    <p>
    I just finished undergrad at UC Berkeley studying cognitive science and design innovation. My endless curiosity for how and why the human mind works the way it does paired with my passion for design drives me to work across disciplines to craft products and experiences that people find easy to use, exciting, and meaningful! If you're curious about what I've done, you can find my resum&eacute; <a class="links" href="images/resume.pdf" target="_newtab">here</a>.

    <p>If you'd like to make cool things together or chat with me please <a class="links" href="mailto:shannonchu@berkeley.edu">get in touch!</a></p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting my website <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> </p>
