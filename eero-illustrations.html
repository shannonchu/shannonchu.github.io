    <h1>Brand illustrations for eero</h1>
    <p>
      <a class="links" href="https://eero.com/">eero</a>, the world's first whole home wifi system, was acquired by Amazon in early 2019. As such, they adopted Amazon’s 14 Leadership Principles, which are core to how these companies operate internally. I helped eero create illustrations that symbolized each of the leadership principles using eero’s bright and playful brand colors and flat illustration style. Finally, I designed a poster combining all of the illustrations to display in their offices.
