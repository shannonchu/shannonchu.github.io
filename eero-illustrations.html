    <h1>Brand illustrations for eero</h1>
    <p>
		In early 2019, <a class="links" href="https://eero.com/">eero</a> was acquired by Amazon and, as such, adopted Amazon’s company values. eero came to XYZ to help them create a poster of Amazon’s 14 Leaderships Principles for their office spaces. They wanted illustrations symbolizing each principle, and for the style to be very literal, using simple shapes and eero’s bright and playful brand colors. I also created an additional poster that lists each principle and its full description, sans illustrations. These are the final results.

		Below are some initial designs that illustrated the leadership principles across several posters.
