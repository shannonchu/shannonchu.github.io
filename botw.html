    <h1>Bank of the West</h1>

    <p>
      For this Bank of the West advertisement, XYZ collaborated with Publicis & Hal Riney to create a bustling port city scene. We wanted the city to include both industrial and agricultural elements, while maintaining a realistic look and feel of a computer chip. I designed the chip patterns and art directed the 3D creation of the chip.
