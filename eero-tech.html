    <h1>Crafting hero images for new eero products</h1>
    <p>
      For the launch of their new products, eero 6 and eero Pro 6, eero needed stylized 3D renders for their website. These needed to be different from the product images they already had that were largely straightforward, orthographic views of their products. I designed the layout with the products floating in space, showcasing product angles in a different and interesting way.

      Originally, I planned to sketch out my layout ideas and then work with a 3D artist to bring those ideas to life, but I decided to dive into 3D to execute the ideas myself. We already had the products modeled in 3D, so I was able to take these models, get them placed into a scene and play with the positions, angles, rotations and depth of field.

      Once we finalized the layout, I worked with 3D artist Mark Velazquez to light & texture the scene and adjust the layout as needed. Our final render is now the hero image on <a href="http://eero.com/technology" class="links">eero's Technology page</a>.
