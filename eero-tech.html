    <h1>Crafting hero images for new eero products</h1>
    <p>
      For the launch of their new products, eero 6 and eero Pro 6, eero needed stylized 3D renders for their website that were different from the product images they already had. The existing imagery largely consisted of straightforward, orthographic views of their products. My job was to create various layout options with their products floating in space to showcase the product angles in different and interesting ways.

      Originally, the plan was to sketch out my layout ideas and then work with a 3D artist to bring those ideas to life, but I decided to dive into 3D to execute the ideas myself. With 3D, I was better able to illustrate my layout ideas, had more control of the positions, angles, rotations and depth of field of each product, and was able to churn out ideas and iterate on them much more quickly than I would have been able to with pen and paper.

      Once we finalized the layout, I worked with 3D artist Mark Velazquez to light and texture the scene. Our final render is now the hero image on <a href="http://eero.com/technology" class="links">eero's Technology page</a>!
