    <h1>Crafting hero images for new eero products</h1>
    <p>
      For the launch of their new products, the eero 6 and eero Pro 6, eero wanted stylized product imagery for their website with a few of their product renders floating in space to show off the product angles. My role was to come up with cool and interesting layouts for this hero image.

      Originally, I planned to sketch out my ideas and then work with a 3D artist to bring those ideas to life, but instead I decided to dive into 3D to execute the ideas myself. We already had the products modeled in 3D, so I was able to take these models, get them placed into a scene and play with the positions, angles, rotations and depth of field. Once we finalized the layout, I worked with 3D artist Mark Velazquez to light and texture the scene. Our final render is now the hero image on <a href="http://eero.com/technology" class="links">eero's Technology page</a>.
