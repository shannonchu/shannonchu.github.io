    <h1>Launching the Lunr Sleep brand</h1>
    <p>
      Mattress startup Lunr Sleep approached my team looking for help launching their brand. We worked on everything from social strategy and content, to building their website. I designed and developed Lunr’s website, which is built in React and integrated with Shopify to handle everything sales, and worked with 3D artist Charlene Wang to create the product imagery.

<!--     <p>
      With an extremely limited budget in regards to both money and time, we had to find quick and creative solutions to create the visuals. Photoshoots are expensive, and mattresses are expensive to ship. Instead of having doing a photoshoot for lifestyle shots of the mattress, I sourced stock photography and retouched them so that the colors in the photo matched Lunr’s brand colors and the look and feel was consistent. I worked with our 3D artist Charlene Wang to create the product imagery. It was more cost-effective to do in 3D than to ship all sizes of the mattress to our studio to be photographed. We're very happy with the results.
