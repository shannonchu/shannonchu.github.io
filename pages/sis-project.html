    <h1>Student Information Systems (SIS) Project</h1>
    <h4>UX & Service Design </h4> <br/>
    <p>
      UC Berkeley's Student Information Systems (SIS) Project is a campus initiative to consolidate all of UC Berkeley's various student information systems into a one-stop-shop student portal: <a class="links" href="http://calcentral.berkeley.edu" target="_newtab">Cal Central.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Summer 2015, I have been a UX Design intern for the project.  My work focuses on bringing the student voice to the desired future state of the Academic Planning & Enrollment efforts of the project, as well as supporting the UX lifecycle around Cal Central development.
    </p>
    <p>
      During summer, another intern Drake Myers and I created a journey map of the class planning and enrollment process.  Our goal was to discover what students go through when planning their schedule and enrolling in classes.  We sought to locate the pain points of current processes and tools, as well as goals and questions during their academic journey.

      The video below runs through the map that we created.

    <h3>The Process</h3>
    <p>
      We started out by gathering SIS students staff for an extensive discussion and whiteboarding session at the SIS Project office. We
       We looked at the main tools students use, for what purposes, and the degree of usage.

    <p>
      Based on our whiteboarding session insights, Drake and I then mapped out what we believed to be the archetype journey for students on paper.  I later created the first version of the journey map in Illustrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went through several iterations of the map after we had students and UX team members study and comment on the map.  In addition, Drake and I planned a Design Studio Workshop: "Planning for My Academic Success" for graduate and undergraduate students, during which we had a segment for them to discuss, study, and make comments on our map.

    <p>
      After many iterations, the flow and content of the journey map was finalized, showcasing what we believed to be the archetype journey that students go through to explore and decide their major, plan their schedule, and enroll in classes every semester.

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <p>
      While creating this map, it didn't feel as though I was discovering new insights.  Because other students and I know the struggle of planning and enrollment so well, the process outlined in our map felt somewhat redundant. But, what felt obvious to me was actually very valuable and interesting to non-student staff members of the project.  In addition, I realized the importance of having fresh eyes for new perspectives and constant feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey map was very well recevied by staff members and it has since been posted around the office for staff & visitors to see.  Seeing it around reminds me of how awesome it is to be a part of a project that is devoted to improving the academic experiences of current and future students, staff and faculty at UC Berkeley.

    <h3>Future</h3>
    <p>
      Once Cal Central's development is completed, ScheduleBuilder, a website that students currently use for schedule planning and sharing, will become obsolete.  This Spring, I am working on a calendar sharing project that will replace similar functions and features provided by ScheduleBuilder, but will be integrated with the new class planning and enrollment tool provided in Cal Central.
