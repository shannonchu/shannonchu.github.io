    <h1>Student Information Systems (SIS) Project</h1>
    <h4>UX & Service Design </h4> <br/>
    <p>
      UC Berkeley's Student Information Systems (SIS) Project is a campus initiative to consolidate all of UC Berkeley's various student information systems into a one-stop-shop student portal: <a class="links" href="http://calcentral.berkeley.edu" target="_newtab">Cal Central.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Summer 2015, I have been a UX Design intern for the project.  My work focuses on bringing the student voice to the desired future state of the Academic Planning & Enrollment efforts of the project.

      During summer, another intern Drake Myers and I created a journey map of the process that students go through when planning their schedules and enrolling in classes.  The video below runs through the map that we created.

      After Cal Central's development is completed, ScheduleBuilder, a website that students currently use for schedule sharing, will become obsolete.  This Spring, I am working on a calendar sharing project that will replace similar functions and features provided by ScheduleBuilder, but will be integrated with the new class planning & enrollment tool provided in Cal Central.
