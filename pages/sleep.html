    <h1>Psychology of Sleep</h1>
    <h4>Graphic design & Advertising</h4> <br/>
    <p>
      For my Psychology of Sleep class, we had to creatively educate the public about sleep using some artifact or form of communication in a Sleep Outreach Project. I decided to create a mock advertising campaign to highlight the importance of sleep and raise awareness of the dangers of sleep deprivation among UC Berkeley students.  Everything was created using Adobe Illustrator.

      A challenging aspect of this project was to restrain the amount of text on each advertisement while still effectively sending the intended message and without withholding information from the audience. I also tried to create a consistent style across each advertisement by using flat designs and bold colors.  This was an incredibly fun project that combined my fascination with the human mind & behavior and my love for graphic design!
