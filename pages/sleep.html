    <h1>Sleep Outreach Project: Advertising Campaign</h1>
    <p>
      In my Psychology of Sleep class we were assigned a Sleep Outreach Project where we had to creatively educate the public about sleep using some artifact or form communication.  Possibilities ranged from a brochure, song, YouTube video, buzzfeed post, a skit, etc.  We then had to reach out and distribute our creation to our target audience.

      I decided to create a mock advertising campaign to highlight the importance of sleep and raise awareness of the dangers of sleep deprivation among UC Berkeley students.  Everything was created using Adobe Illustrator.

      A challenging aspect of this project was to restrain the amount of text on each advertisement while still effectively sending the intended message and without withholding information from the audience.
