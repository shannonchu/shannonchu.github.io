    <h1>TENSOS</h1>
    <h4>Product, packaging & Graphic design</h4> <br/>
    <p>
      In my Product Development class, I worked with a multi-disciplinary team of engineering and business students to explore human-centered design opportunities in developing a toy tensegrity to be used for educational outreach and to foster interest in STEM fields.
    </p>

      (Note: we changed the product name to TENSOS after we had already constructed our final prototype packaging, which is why it says Tensegrity Kit instead of TENSOS.)

    <h3>What is tensegrity?</h3>
    <p>
      Put simply, a tensegrity is a 3-dimensional structure consisting of rigid members that don't touch and are suspended by a web of cords under tension.  A tensegrity structure has a dynamic of basically being stretched apart and pulled together at the same time!
    </p>
    <p>
      NASA is exploring tensegrity concepts to build the next generation of planetary rovers. This is because tensegrity structures can flexibly move and respond to changes in surrounding, which could allow for more resilient and reliable spacecrafts.

    <h3>Our mission</h3>
    <p>
      We set out to provide K-8 school children an affordable and engaging toy that allows them to explore basic scientific concepts and learn about current NASA research and how it is being applied to explore the galaxy. We wanted our product to help nurture a fascination for science in kids at an early age so that they pursue STEM related careers in the future.
    </p>

    <h3>The process</h3>
    <p>
      As this was for a product development class, we went through the entire product development lifecycle. We had to design our product with two different demographics in mind: our target customers (the parents and teachers actually purchasing our product), and our end users (children). It was a special challenge tackling this dual nature to create a product that would appeal to parents but also keep kids engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spoke to people to determine customer and user needs, analyzed competing products, and researched related products available in the market. We generated over 120 ideas for our product, which we eventually narrowed down to 3. We tested our top 3 designs with potential customers and users, iterating and honing our prototypes based on feedback. We also conducted business analyses on our various concepts. After aggregating comments and suggestions, the team decided to merge all three concepts into one overarching design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The team collectively worked on building the final prototype and business plan. Luckily, we had team members from a variety of backgrounds including mechanical engineering, business, design, and cognitive science. Everyone's skills and expertise shone when executing the final product.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was primarily responsible for designing all of the product visuals. This included the brand identity, packaging, and instruction manual. I created designs that would excite and engage kids and that would work across various mediums (print on paper versus laser cut into wood). It was especially exciting designing the packaging because it was my first time working with laser cutters and had to design with laser cutter restrictions in mind.

    <h3>The product</h3>
    <p>
      TENSOS is a fun, affordable, and interactive toy building kit for K-8 children that teaches about tensegrity, NASA, and how to build your own tensegrity toy.  TENSOS generates interest in STEM fields through building and playing!
    </p>
    <p>
      The TENSOS building kit comes with all the materials needed to build your own tensegrity model and an instruction manual complete with colorful and clean visuals, kid-friendly instructions on how to assemble various tensegrity models, and background information to educate users on tensegrity concepts and how NASA is utilizing tensegrity for space exploration.

    <p>
      At the end of the semester, each team made an elevator pitch to faculty and industry judges and presented our product in a final tradeshow where judges were free to check out projects they were interested in.  Our team was lucky enough to speak with and show our final product to a member of the NASA tensegrity team!

<!--     <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <p>
      We had team members from a variety of backgrounds including mechanical engineering, business administration, and cognitive science. Everyone on the team had something unique to offer to the project and teach one another. One key lesson was learning to listen to one another's input in the brainstorming process. No matter how ridiculous the idea, it allowed us to build upon that idea and be creative, which ultimately helped us come up with our final product.
