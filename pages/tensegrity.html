<p>
Over the course of a semester and with a multi-disciplinary team of engineering and business students, we developed a tensegrity toy from initial idea to final product.  TENSOS is a fun, affordable, and interactive toy building kit for K-8 children that teaches about tensegrity, NASA, and how to build your own tensegrity toy and generates interest in STEM fields through building and playing!
