    <h1>TENSOS</h1>
    <h4>Product, packaging & Graphic design</h4> <br/>
    <p>
      In my Product Development class, I worked with a multi-disciplinary team of engineering and business students to explore human-centered design opportunities in developing a toy tensegrity to be used for educational outreach and to foster interest in STEM fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      TENSOS is a fun, affordable, and interactive toy building kit for K-8 children that teaches about tensegrity, NASA, and how to build your own tensegrity toy.  TENSOS generates interest in STEM fields through building and playing!
    </p>
    <p>
      (Note: we changed the product name to TENSOS after we had already constructed our final prototype packaging, which is why it says Tensegrity Kit instead of TENSOS.)

      At the end of the semester, each team made an elevator pitch to faculty and industry judges and presented our product in a final tradeshow where judges were free to check out projects they were interested in.  Our team was lucky enough to speak with and show our final product to a member of the NASA team working on tensegrity robots!
