    <p>
      TENSOS is a fun, affordable, and interactive toy building kit for K-8 children that teaches about tensegrity, NASA, and how to build your own tensegrity toy.  TENSOS generates interest in STEM fields through building and playing!

    <p>
      Over the course of a semester with a multi-disciplinary team of engineering and business students, we explored human-centered design opportunities in developing a toy tensegrity to be used for educational outreach and to foster interest in STEM fields and developed a product from initial idea to final product.
