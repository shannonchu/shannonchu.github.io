      For the launch of their new products, the eero 6 and eero Pro 6, eero wanted stylized product imagery for their website with a few of their product renders floating in space and showing off various product angles. My job was to come up with cool and interesting layouts for the floating products.

      I was originally planning to sketch out my ideas and then work with a 3D artist to bring my ideas to life, but since this project wasn't on a tight deadline, I decided to learn some 3D to better convey my ideas. We already had the products modeled in 3D, so I was able to take these models, get them placed into a scene and play with the positions, angles, rotations and depth of field. Once we finalized the layout, I worked with 3D artist Mark Velazquez to light and texture the scene. Our final render is now the hero image on <a href="http://eero.com/technology" class="links">eero's Technology page</a>.
