    <h1>Bank of the West</h1>
    <h4 class="category">Graphic design & Art Direction</h4> <br/>
    <p>
      For this Bank of the West advertisement, XYZ collaborated with Publicis & Hal Riney to create a bustling port city scene. We wanted the city to include both industrial and agricultural elements, while maintaining a realistic look and feel of a computer chip. I designed the chip patterns and art directed the 3D creation of the chip. Patterns were created using Illustrator.
