<h1>Aspen Luxury Rental</h1>
<h4>Web Design</h4> <br/>
	<p>
		Redesigned the website for a beautiful estate in Aspen, Colorado. See the transformation <a class="links" target="default" href="http://luxuryaspenrental.com">here</a>.

<h3>The Process</h3>
	<p>
		Client came to me looking for a website redesign to attract business. The old website looked extremely outdated. It needed to be modernized. While it boasted a wealth of information about the space, it was presented in a way that wasn't visually appealing. The site structure and stylistic choices did not match the beauty of the home. Not only that, it hardly showcased the home as photos were too small. It was too much telling, not enough showing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Laying out the site structure and mocking up designs on paper were my first step. I researched websites for home rentals and real estate, taking notes on elements I wanted to include on the new website. I wanted to create a vivid and memorable website that displayed the home's luxury and beautiful natural surroundings using large photography and complementary visual elements. More showing, less telling. Some of my mockups can be seen below.

	<p>
		The previous website was built with WordPress, but it didn't make sense time-wise to try and dissect the WordPress site and rearrange everything there. The client wanted the site to be launched as soon as possible, so we decided that it would be more efficient to build a new site from scratch. To save even more time, we chose to use a website builder, Wix. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Since I already had a design in mind, I built the site from a blank template instead of opting for a pre-designed template. The website welcomes you with a highlight reel of the space (edited by yours truly) followed by a run-through of the home's features. An air of luxury was achieved using solid black and golden colors and marble accents. The use of both san-serif and serif fonts was chosen for a modern-classic feel that pairs well with the look of luxury. Images are large and information plentiful to entice visitors in becoming guests.
