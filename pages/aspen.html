<h1>Aspen Luxury Estate</h1>
<h4 class="category">Web Design</h4> <br/>

		Designed and launched a new website for a beautiful estate in Aspen, Colorado. <!-- The client came to me looking for a website redesign to attract business.  --> See the full transformation <a class="links" target="default" href="http://luxuryaspenrental.com">here</a>.

<!-- <h3>The Process</h3>
	<p>
		The old site looked outdated, a little glum. While it boasted a wealth of information about the space, the information was presented in a way that wasn't visually appealing. The site structure and stylistic choices did not match the beauty of the home. Not only that, it hardly showed the home as photos were either stock photos or too small. The new site needed more showing, less telling. It needed to be modernized and have a little more pizzazz.

	<p>
		Laying out the site structure and mocking up designs on paper were my first step. I researched competitor websites for home rentals and real estate, taking notes on elements I wanted to include on the new website. I wanted to create a vivid and memorable website that displayed the home's luxury and beautiful natural surroundings using large photography and complementary visual elements.
	</p>
	<p>
		The previous website was built with WordPress, but it didn't make sense time-wise to try and dissect the WordPress site and rearrange everything there. The client wanted the site to be launched as soon as possible, so we decided that it would be more efficient to build a new site from scratch. To save even more time, we chose to use a website builder, Wix. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Since I already had a design in mind, I built the site from a blank template instead of opting for a pre-designed template. The website welcomes you with a highlight reel of the space (edited by yours truly) followed by a run-through of the home's features. An air of luxury was achieved using solid black and golden colors and marble accents. The mix of san-serif and serif fonts was chosen for a modern-classic feel that pairs well with the look of luxury, while script fonts added a touch of playfulness. Images are large and information plentiful to entice visitors in becoming guests.
