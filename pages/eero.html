		In early 2019, <a class="links" href="https://eero.com/">eero</a> was acquired by Amazon and, as such, adopted Amazon’s company values. eero came to XYZ to help them create a poster of Amazon’s 14 Leaderships Principles for their office spaces. They wanted us to create graphics symbolizing each principle, and for the style to be very literal, using simple shapes and eero’s bright and playful brand colors. I also created a second, more in-depth poster that lists out all the principles and their full descriptions, sans graphics. These are the final results.

    I spent a couple days ideating graphics on pencil and paper. After finalizing the graphics with the client, I dove into Illustrator to digitally illustrate each one and layout the design of the full poster. I decided to present everything on a 3 by 5 grid design so that it included the 14 principles plus a title card, using colorblocking to separate everything.
