      PerimeterX is a leading cybersecurity company that specializes in stopping robot attacks. They wanted to create an outdoor campaign that would raise awareness during RSA, a cybersecurity conference happening at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. I worked with 3D artists <a class="links" href="https://www.vfx-shot.com/" target="new">Maulik Majmudar</a> and <a class="links" href="http://zaidzanata.com" target="new">Zaid Abouzeid</a> at XYZ to concept and design a couple of advertisements that would be part of a geo-targeted campaign near the convention center. The campaign highlights the dangers that robots present to everyone online, specifically the threat they pose to user accounts.
