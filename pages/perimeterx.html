    <p>
      PerimeterX is a leading cybersecurity company that specializes in stopping robot attacks. They wanted to create an outdoor campaign that would raise awareness during RSA, a big security conference happening at Moscone Center in San Francisco.

      I worked directly with 3D and retouch artists at XYZ to design a couple of advertisements that would be part of a geo-targeted campaign near the convention center. The campaign highlights the dangers that robots present to everyone online, specifically the threat they pose to user accounts.

      This project was especially cool because it was the first out-of-home ad campaign I worked on that I saw in real life posted throughout the streets of downtown San Francisco :')
