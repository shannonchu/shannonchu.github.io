  <h1>Ashby Village Square</h1>
    <p>
      Starting my senior year at Berkeley, I was fortunate to join <a class="links" href="http://calblueprint.org" target="_newtab">Cal Blueprint</a> as a Project Developer.  Blueprint is a group of student engineers that create web and mobile applications for our non-profit partners pro bono.  We are dedicated to serving our community through bridging technology and social good.

    <p>
      During Fall 2015, I worked with a team of five developers to design and develop <b>Ashby Village Square</b>, a communications & events platform for <a class="links" href="http://ashbyvillage.org" target="_newtab">Ashby Village</a>, a Bay Area organization that helps senior citizens connect with each other to remain active and independent by providing social and interest groups for members to lead and join.
    </p><br/>
  <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
    <p>
      Prior to Blueprint's involvement, the main forms of group organization and communication were a cluttered calendar, lengthy newsletters, online forums with little activity and third-party tools like Yahoo groups.  Ashby Village wanted our help in building an application that would support and facilitate connections, communication, and event planning among its growing member base.

    <p>
      This project presented an exciting design challenge because of its audience: senior citizens. Because today's technology is catered toward those of younger generations, it has proven difficult for the elderly to grasp.  As a result, senior citizens have either become averse to using technology or had to learn how to use something that wasn't made for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We understood that none of today's established design principles would apply to our app because these standards were set with a younger generation of users in mind.  Our biggest concern was designing for ease of use and accessibility, and our biggest question was "Once we've finish building this application for them, will they even use it?"
    </p><br/>
  <h3>THE PROCESS</h3>
    <p>
      Our team dedicated the first few weeks of the semester learning about the user experience.  We conducted user interviews to familiarize ourselves with Ashby Village as an organization and its members' technical expertise.  We also discovered some research & articles that discussed how to cater technology to the elderly.  At the same time, we began developing the back-end framework of the app using Ruby on Rails.

    <p>
      As a team, we discussed and made design decisions based on our research and created wireframes using Sketch. Once we finalized our designs, we began developing the front-end and conducted user tests with Invision to see how Ashby Village members responded to the app.  It was a constant process of iteration: designing & developing, user testing, gathering feedback, and applying our insights to new design decisions.

  <h3>MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP)</h3>

    <p>
      For the MVP, we set out to provide Ashby Village members a platform for group creation, the ability to join groups, event creation, and communication within groups.

    <p>
      At the end of the semester, we had a soft-product-launch to introduce Ashby Village members and staff to Ashby Village Square.  During this event, our team showcased the application's features and assisted Ashby Village members in creating their own accounts and navigating the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Spring, our team will continue production, expanding on the minimal viable product to develop additional features and refine its current state.
