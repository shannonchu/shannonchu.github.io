<p>
  Starting my senior year at Berkeley, I was fortunate to join the incredible student organization <a class="links" href="http://calblueprint.org" target="_newtab">Cal Blueprint</a> as a Project Developer.  Blueprint is a group of student engineers that create web and mobile apps for our non-profit partners pro bono.  We are dedicated to serving our community through bridging technology and social good.
</p>
<p>
  During Fall of 2015, I worked in a team of five developers to design and develop a communications platform for Ashby Village, a Bay Area organization that helps senior citizens connect with each other to remain active and independent, using Ruby on Rails.
</p>
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p>
  The Ashby Village project presented an exciting challenge because of its audience: senior citizens. Today's technology is catered toward those of younger generations who have had greater exposure to and more experience with today's technology, therefore making the technology difficult for seniors to grasp.

  how do we design for ease of use
  will they even use it?!??!?!
</p>
<h3>THE PROCESS</h3>
<p>
  Instead of beginning development right away, our team dedicated the first few weeks of the semester for UX work.  We conducted extensive user research to familiarize ourselves with Ashby Village dynamics and its members' technical expertise through interviews with various members of the village.  We also looked into research that has been conducted on catering technology to the elderly.

</p>
<p>
  Once we finalized our designs, we began user testing to see how

  Constant process of designing & developing, user testing, and insights design decisions

<h3>MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT</h3>
<p>
  WHAT IS ASHBY VILLAGE SQUARE & TALK ABOUT FEATURES & WHAT I WORKED ON
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the semester, we had a soft-launch to introduce Ashby Village members and staff to Ashby Village Square.  During this event, our team showcased the application's features and assisted Ashby Village members in creating their own accounts and navigating the application.
</p>
<p>
  This Spring, our team will continue production, expanding on the minimal viable product to develop additional features and refine its current state.
