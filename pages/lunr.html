      Mattress startup Lunr paired up with XYZ to launch their brand. We worked on everything from social strategy and content to building their website. I helped design and develop <a class="links" href="https://lunrsleep.com">Lunr’s website</a>, which is built in React and integrated with Shopify to handle all sales. Since they only sell one product, we decided that it made sense to have a single page website that contains all the product and contact information.

      With an extremely limited budget, we had to find creative solutions to create the visuals. Photoshoots are expensive, and mattresses are expensive to ship! Instead of having an entire photoshoot for lifestyle shots of the Lunr mattress, I sourced stock photography and retouched them so that the colors in the photo matched Lunr’s brand colors and the look and feel had some consistency. I worked with 3D artists to create the product photos. It was more cost-effective to do in 3D than to ship all sizes of the mattress to a studio to be photographed.
