  <h4>UI/UX design & Healthcare</h4> <br/>
    <p>
      In my Human-Centered Design class at UC Berkeley, we were given the task to choose an aspect of the healthcare experience that we felt needed improvement and to redesign that aspect of the healthcare experience.  Based on personal experiences, my partners and I saw a need to minimize the time spent waiting for care in non-emergency health situations.

      Because this project had to be completed within 2 weeks, we didn't have time for extensive user research in hospitals.  Thus, our research involved watching the 2012 documentary titled <em>The Waiting Room</em> that showcased the distress and impatience experienced by large influxes of patients in the waiting room. In addition, we found that in California, the average wait time in an emergency room is 30 minutes. At the Alameda County Medical Center, this jumps to 94 minutes.

      From our research, we converged on an app that finds the closest medical center to you based on your current location and specific needs.  In addition, it gives you real-time approximate waiting times of suggested medical care facilities, along with the directions to each facility, and alerts the facility you choose of your arrival.

      We created our mockup using Balsamiq.  In this prototype, we did not pay particular attention to the aesthetics of the design.  Instead, we focused on the intention of the app and the user experience to make sure that it would be easy to maneuver and understand.

      During Spring Break, I decided to redesign the initial prototype using Photoshop. Because our initial design was low fidelity, I wanted to create a more legitimate design while keeping the skeleton of the original prototype.

    <p>
      Since the app is supposed to be used during medical emergencies where people are typically in shock or distressed, I wanted a design that is calming and easy to maneuver during a stressful situation.  I went for a minimal design so that the app would be easy to use and understand during an urgent medical emergency.

      I changed the mostly red color scheme of the original prototype because red seemed a bit too demanding and aggressive.  Instead, I chose a cool blue-green hue that is stress-reducing, but is also bold enough to add some brightness to the dull situation.

      Our initial prototype did not have an actual logo, so I wanted to make one that was easily identifible and simple.  The overlapping and dual-toned letters reminded me of the double-helical structure of DNA or the spiral structure of some proteins, especially in the 'M', which I felt fitting for a medical app.

      The app provides users with the opportunity to not only shorten wait times by alerting the care facility of their impending arrival, but could also distribute wait times across all medical centers in the country so that we can avoid a 3 hour wait for a broken foot!
