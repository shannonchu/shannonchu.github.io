<h1>Rugged Shampoo</h1>

<p>
<i>Rugged</i> is a Sierra Nevada shampoo line for adventurers and outdoor connoisseurs based on the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, and winter.  Our shampoo product is formulated using only organic ingredients and infused with Sierra Nevada beer for luscious and healthy locks and scents that truly embody nature.
</p>
<p>
<i>Rugged</i> came to life through the 2016 CMYK Designathon, a four-hour design competition hosted by Innovative Design, Cal's student-run creative agency that provides design and photography services to other on-campus organizations and off-campus organizations. (Fun fact: I was a part of Innovative Design for one semester!)
</p>
<p>
Innovative Design brought in Sierra Nevada as our client, and each team was tasked with addressing one of the three provided design prompts.  Our team chose to conceive and design a Sierra Nevada shampoo product and branding campaign.
</p>
<p>
For our brand image, we incorporated a seasonal aspect for our product
</p>
<p>
One of my team members, Kevin Wu, created a <a class="links" href="http://rugged-shampoo.herokuapp.com">beautiful website</a> showcasing our product.  Grace Noh, another team member, designed <i>Rugged</i>'s awesome logo to include some of the most rugged elements of nature, rocks and mountains, while also staying consistent with Sierra Nevada's brand image.  Caleb Wang, the remaining team member, focused his efforts on market research and using his insights to help craft our marketing efforts.
<p>
To continue with the outdoorsy theme, I designed our packaging to have clean visuals, natural colors, and to emulate the four seasons with four flavors.

Our flavors include Sierra, a spring scent, Chico for summer, Logger for fall, and Grizzly for winter.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the competition, each team pitched their product to a panel of professional designer judges.  <i>Rugged</i> was awarded <b>First Place</b> overall and <b>Best Use of Lettering</b>!
