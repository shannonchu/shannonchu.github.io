    Rugged is a Sierra Nevada shampoo line for adventurers and outdoor connoisseurs based on the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter.  Our shampoo product is formulated using only organic ingredients and infused with Sierra Nevada beer for luscious and healthy locks and scents that truly embody nature.

    Rugged came to life through the 2015 CMYK Designathon, a four-hour design competition hosted by Innovative Design, Cal's student-run creative agency that provides design and photography services to other on-campus organizations and off-campus organizations. <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Each team was tasked with addressing one of the three provided design prompts regarding Sierra Nevada, the client.  Our team chose the prompt that asked for us to conceive and design a Sierra Nevada shampoo product and branding campaign.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the Sierra Nevada brand is targeted towards men, we wanted our brand to appeal to those rugged, adventurous, and strong men who drink Sierra Nevada and enjoy the outdoors.  We incorporated the four seasons to bring in a truly natural element of our world.

    One of my team members, Kevin Wu, created a <a class="links" href="http://rugged-shampoo.herokuapp.com" target="_newtab">beautiful website</a> showcasing our product.  Grace Noh, another team member, designed Rugged's awesome logo to include some of the most rugged elements of nature: rocks and mountains, while also staying consistent with Sierra Nevada's brand image.  Caleb Wang, the third team member, focused his efforts on market research and using his insights to help craft our brand image.
  </p>
  <p>
    To continue with the outdoorsy theme, I designed our packaging to have clean visuals, natural colors, and to emulate the four seasons with four flavors.  The flavors we came up with included Sierra, a spring scent, Chico for summer, Logger for fall, and Grizzly for winter.  So, I designed each bottle's color to encapsulate and evoke the mood of the season it represented and its name.

    I also pen-tooled the letters in Rugged's logo.  To maintain consistency, I designed the lettering so that it blended in with Sierra Nevada's logo and brand image, but with more jagged and rougher features.

    At the end of the competition, each team pitched their product to a panel of professional designer judges.  Rugged was awarded First Place overall and Best Use of Lettering!
