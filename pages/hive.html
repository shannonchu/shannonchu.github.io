<h1>Reimagining Slums</h1>
<h4 class="category">Urban Design & Human-Centered Design</h4> <br/>
    <p>
      In partnership with SF-based architectural firm <a target="default" class="links" href="http://www.utopiacities.org/">Utopia</a>, I worked with 3 other students to design a modular and sustainable floating house and community space for residents of flood-prone Muara Baru, a slum village in Jakarta, Indonesia.
    </p>
    <p>
    	We approached urban planning from a human-centered design perspective and conducted user research, persona development, ideation and protoyping. Read our step-by-step process creating this space, which is detailed <a class="links" target="default" href="https://floatinghouse.weebly.com/">here</a>.

<h3>The Problem</h3>
	<p>
		Muara Baru is a slum in Northern Jakarta, Indonesia that faces a unique problem in regards to available land area as well as extensive environmental factors that heavily impact people's homes. Slum dwellers in Muara Baru live along a limited waterfront in an area where daily tides and seasonal storm surges threaten their homes with constant flooding, which results in pollution, trash, and health problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		This problem is compounded by the fact that Jakarta itself is sinking, in some areas from 6 to 17 inches per year, a major factor in considering even short term housing solutions. In addition to these various environmental and sanitation issues that affect their homes, there is a lack of space within the slum in general, and even less space available for public community use.
	</p>
	<p>
		We wanted to know how we might: create durable, affordable, quality housing; resource locally acessible materials without exacerbating the trash and pollution problems; and support the jobs and livelihoods of the people of Muara Baru.
	</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>
	<p>
		It was important for us to create a space that was practical to the people of Muara Baru. My main role for this project was learning about the slum's socio-economic and cultural values, including what jobs people typically have, what materials they typically use to build infrastructure and how they source these resources, and incorporating these aspects into our final solution.
	</p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
	<p>
		We set out to provide the people of Muara Baru with a housing solution and better living conditions by designing a modular, structurally sound floating home that responds to and changes with their dynamic environment. We wanted the homes to be built and maintained by slum residents, so we designed the architecture to be something easily learned and maintained. Below are digital renderings showing architectural details of the home and hexagonal floating platforms.

	<p>
		The structure we designed is dual-purpose: the top-level serves as a living space, and the bottom level serves as an open community space. The top half is covered to provide shelter and privacy; and the bottom is open so that when the sea level rises/tide becomes unstable, slum residents would not need to worry about their belongings getting destroyed or washed away.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hexagonal platform below the structure brings in the modular and scalable aspect. Platforms can be linked together in a honeycomb formation. Because the homes themselves wouldn't cover the entire area of the hexagonal base, the extra space on the platform serves as walking space between homes, which is limited in the Muara Baru slum. In addition, some platforms would be empty and not have a home built on them, creating more public community space.
	</p>

	<p>
		The main materials used to build the structures would be wood, bamboo, zinc sheets and cloth. These materials are often scavenged from nearby dumps. The water surrounding the slum brings in a lot of trash and plastic, including empty water barrels, which are attached to the bottom of the platforms, keeping the structure afloat. 
	</p>
<!-- 		<p>
			In building a floating house, we had to consider many different factors including what materials to use to keep the structure afloat, anchoring techninques, and housing types. We pulled a lot of inspiration from floating structures that exist today such as the Makoko floating school in Lagos Lagoon, Nigeria and other hypothetical floating home concepts like the zero-emission, modular & scalable floating community proposed in Halong Bay, Vietnam.

<h3>Some Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
    	As a designer, it was hard to tackle this project because 1) I had no urban design/architecture experience; 2) we were designing for a group of people we had never interacted with or spoken to; and 3) we didn't want to design something that would be impractible and intrusive to their culture, but we couldn't test our concept with real users, which was extremely frustrating. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Through studying different slums around the world, we learned about how slums are integral to economic growth, how these communities are hotbeds for innovation, and the strong sense of community and culture that transcended any hardships. Over the course of this project, I was made aware of the complexity of the issue we were trying to solve. Poor living conditions and public health issues are just a few of the factors that plague slum communities, and there isn't a one-thing-cures-all solution because each slum is so unique.
